We at Wellsect LLC (‘Wellsect,' 'we,' 'us,' 'our') know that our users ('you,' 'your') care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting or using our website (www.wellsect.com) and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, mobile applications, or any other services we offer from time to time by in connection therewith (collectively, the 'Website'), or by using the App (as that term is defined in the License Agreement) in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.
<br>
What does this privacy policy cover?
<br>
This privacy policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ('personal information') that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website and App. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
<br>
Regarding Children:
<br>
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services (as that term is defined in our License Agreement). If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or on the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at: hello@wellsect.com.
<br>
What information does Wellsect collect?
<br>
We gather various types of personal information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this personal information to personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Website and App, and as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. We may share certain types of personal information with third parties. We collect the following types of information:
<br>
Information you provide to us:
<br>
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect personal information such as your name, username, email address, gender, birth date, ethnicity, weight, height, location, insurance provider, nutrition data, workouts, physical activity, and sleep habits and we may collect other sleep, activity, or health-related information as our services and products are further developed (collectively “Personal Information”). You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or our partners or to take advantage of some features. We may, but not always, anonymize your personal information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. For example, you may tell us that you are female and sleep an average of 6 hours per night; we may combine this information with content received from our other users, and disclose to our partners that on the whole, our male users sleep more hours per night than our female ones, but we will not tell those partners who you are. We may use third party service providers and suppliers to facilitate the Website, App and Services we provide, and they may have access to Personal Information. In addition, we may buy or sell business assets or be acquired by or acquire other organizations. In such transactions, Personal Information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In addition, in the event we merge or consolidate with another organization, Personal Information may be transferred to the successor entity. We may also disclose Personal Information to other affiliated institutions and/or if we are required to do so by law.
<br>
Information collected automatically:
<br>
Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, 'cookie' information, and the page you requested. 'Cookies' are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people. Wellsect does not save any personal information in the cookie and cannot connect the information in the cookie to a specific person. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer’s or device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website's best features.
<br>
When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often people use our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
<br>
If you are using the Product in connection with the Services, you understand and acknowledge that when you use the Product, any information, data, or readings from the Product will be automatically uploaded to your account with us. To the extent these automatically collected readings can be used to personally identify you, these readings are personal information for the purposes of this privacy policy.
<br>
Interest based advertising and retargeting:
<br>
There exists a range of different kinds of online interest based advertising and retargeting services; from fairly simple forms to the far-reaching monitoring of web surfer activities carried out by search-engine owners or services carried out in partnerships between technology companies and Internet Service Providers. As a common denomination, you could say that interest based advertising and retargeting is intended to make online display advertising more relevant to web surfers' likely interests.
<br>
Wellsect's interest based advertising and retargeting services are cookie and web beacon based. Based on the anonymous information stored in the User's cookie, Wellsect is able to provide more relevant advertising to the User. For example, a User that visits sports sites often will be categorized in the 'sports fan' segment, and will primarily be served advertisements that are relevant to the interests of a sports fan, and a User that shows interest in a certain car model or a certain computer model, may be served advertisements or specific offers for such car model or computer model.
<br>
Interest based advertising:
<br>
Interest based advertising is Wellsect's solution for optimizing the selection of ads for a certain user. The selection of ads is based on an interest profile built up during visits to websites.
<br>
Interest based advertising step by step:
<br>
A website user browses sites. The category of each website is saved to a cookie in the web browser.
<br>
When the website user browse sites related to cars the counter for category "Automotive" is updated in the cookie.
<br>
Ads are selected and shown to the user based on the category count in the cookie. A user with a higher than average count in the "Automotive" category will be shown more ads related to cars.
<br>
Retargeting
Retargeting is a solution for displaying ads based on which websites or pages the user has visited before.
<br>
Retargeting step by step:
<br>
The user browses a website that runs a retargeting campaign.
<br>
Information on what pages the user visits on the website is stored in a cookie in the user's web browser.
<br>
When the user visits the Wellsect site, ads may be shown to the user based on the information in the retargeting cookie.
<br>
Benefits
For the website user targeting means that more relevant ads will be displayed, ads that match the user's interests. For example, a user visiting more travel websites than average will be served more ads related to travel. A user being interested in a certain product will be served ads with offers related to that product.
<br>
Wellsect does not save any personal information in the cookie and cannot connect the information in the cookie to a specific person.
<br>
You can opt out from our targeting solutions as noted below; when you have opted out you will not be served ads based on your interests and no targeting information will be stored in your web browser. Note that the blocking ends if you clear your browser from cookies.  Also, if you delete cookies or set your browser to disallow cookies, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our website.
<br>
Delete targeting cookies
Your interest profile can be removed by deleting your browser's cookies.
<br>
Information stored on cookies
The cookie information stored on the User's hard drive for interest based advertising and retargeting purposes is: (i) User segment hits or information on a specific product, service, brand or model in which the User has shown interest during its visit to a certain website and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User profile.
<br>
If the cookie is deleted by the User, all profile data is removed. For the sake of clarity, no segments relating to information which Wellsect considers sensitive have been or will be created, such as segments relating to political opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or sexual life. Further, Wellsect is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and marketing directed to children. No segments are intended to be established for the profiling of children.
